                <h1>My name is Andrew and living the simple life saved my life</h1>
                <p>Unconsciously, we engage with a lot of things in life. In so doing, we often fail to
                    reap the true benefits of keeping things as simple as possible in our daily lives.</p>
                <p>Heartbreak, with a combination of other factors meant that I was at a very low point
                    in my life.</p>

                <h3>How I transformed things to my advantage</h3>
                <p>It was almost lights out for me, had to move into a smaller apartment after selling my old
                    place. Most of my remaining belongings were disposed off all, on top of quitting my job.</p>
                <p>It was a really challenging time for me as everything was chaotic. Fortunately for
                    me it all panned out well in the end.</p>

                <h3>I am now living a simple and stress free life</h3>
                <p>Adopting some of the ideas shared on the platform really uplifted my outlook towards life, and I no
                    longer feel choked
                    up with stress.</p>
                <p>All the improved benefits I feel in my life now is why the idea of floating this site
                    came to mind. I really want to tell the world how I did it and how it can benefit our
                    lives!</p>
