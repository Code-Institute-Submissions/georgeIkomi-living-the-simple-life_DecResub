                <h3>Keeping Cooking Simple</h3>
                <p class="article-content">Since the inception of time, food has been one of
                    the main ingredients for sustaining life. Research has proven, time and time
                    again, the direct correlation between eating healthy and living healthy lives.
                    Making your cooking simple and nice is one of the easiest ways to do it.</p>

                <h3>Simplicity and Work</h3>
                <p class="article-content">The challenges that come along with our jobs is often
                    one of the leading causes of stress in our lives. Frustration, ruining of
                    relationship with others, and burnout are some of issues stress leads to.
                    Getting that much sought after work-life balance can be achieved by applying
                    simplicity (as often as possible) to our work environment.</p>

                <h3>Simple Decorations</h3>
                <p class="article-content">Studies have also shown that our personal surroundings
                    indirectly determines or leads to whether or not we live a healthy life.
                    It's something people are either oblivious to, don't decorate, or over do
                    it when they do, but applying simplicity to something as mundane as decorating
                    our personal surroundings can go a very long way in our quest to live a healthy
                    and happy life.</p>
